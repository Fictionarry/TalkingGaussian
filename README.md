## Installation

Tested on Ubuntu 18.04, CUDA 11.3, PyTorch 1.12.1

```
git clone git@github.com:Fictionarry/TalkingGaussian.git --recursive

conda env create --file environment.yml
conda activate talking_gaussian
pip install "git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d.git"
pip install tensorflow-gpu==2.8.0
```

If encounter installation problem from the `diff-gaussian-rasterization` or `gridencoder`, please refer to [gaussian-splatting](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting) and [torch-ngp](https://github.com/ashawkey/torch-ngp).

### Preparation

- Prepare face-parsing model and  the 3DMM model for head pose estimation.

  ```bash
  bash scripts/prepare.sh
  ```

- Download 3DMM model from [Basel Face Model 2009](https://faces.dmi.unibas.ch/bfm/main.php?nav=1-1-0&id=details):

  ```bash
  # 1. copy 01_MorphableModel.mat to data_util/face_tracking/3DMM/
  # 2. run following
  cd data_utils/face_tracking
  python convert_BFM.py
  ```

- Prepare the environment for [EasyPortrait](https://github.com/hukenovs/easyportrait):

  ```bash
  # prepare mmcv
  conda activate talking_gaussian
  pip install -U openmim
  mim install mmcv-full==1.7.1

  # download model weight
  cd data_utils/easyportrait
  wget "https://rndml-team-cv.obs.ru-moscow-1.hc.sbercloud.ru/datasets/easyportrait/experiments/models/fpn-fp-512.pth"
  ```

### Video Dataset
[Here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1E_8W805lioIznqbkvTQHWWi5IFXUG7Er?usp=drive_link) we provide two video clips used in our experiments, which are captured from YouTube. Please respect the original content creators' rights and comply with YouTubeâ€™s copyright policies in the usage.

Other used videos can be found from [GeneFace](https://github.com/yerfor/GeneFace) and [AD-NeRF](https://github.com/YudongGuo/AD-NeRF). 


### Pre-processing Training Video

* Put training video under `data/<ID>/<ID>.mp4`.

  The video **must be 25FPS, with all frames containing the talking person**. 
  The resolution should be about 512x512, and duration about 1-5 min.

* Run script to process the video.

  ```bash
  python data_utils/process.py data/<ID>/<ID>.mp4
  ```

* Obtain Action Units
  
  Run `FeatureExtraction` in [OpenFace](https://github.com/TadasBaltrusaitis/OpenFace), rename and move the output CSV file to `data/<ID>/au.csv`.

* Generate tooth masks

  ```bash
  export PYTHONPATH=./data_utils/easyportrait 
  python ./data_utils/easyportrait/create_teeth_mask.py ./data/<ID>
  ```

### Audio Pre-process

In our paper, we use DeepSpeech features for evaluation. 

* DeepSpeech

  ```bash
  python data_utils/deepspeech_features/extract_ds_features.py --input data/<name>.wav # saved to data/<name>.npy
  ```

- HuBERT

  Similar to ER-NeRF, HuBERT is also available. Recommended for situations if the audio is not in English.

  Specify `--audio_extractor hubert` when training and testing.

  ```
  python data_utils/hubert.py --wav data/<name>.wav # save to data/<name>_hu.npy
  ```

### Train

```bash
# If resources are sufficient, partially parallel is available to speed up the training. See the script.
bash scripts/train_xx.sh data/<ID> output/<project_name> <GPU_ID>
```

### Test

```bash
# saved to output/<project_name>/test/ours_None/renders
python synthesize_fuse.py -S data/<ID> -M output/<project_name> --eval  
```

### Inference with target audio

```bash
python synthesize_fuse.py -S data/<ID> -M output/<project_name> --use_train --audio <preprocessed_audio_feature>.npy
```
